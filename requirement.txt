Begin by opening a fresh terminal. Windows users must open their terminal as administator as follows:
Input C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe directly into the system search bar and launch the program as Administrator from the resulting menu.
With your terminal open as indicated for your operating system, cd into your local github repo folder 'Mulitblockchain-wallet' and run the following code:
 git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
  cd hd-wallet-derive
  curl https://getcomposer.org/installer -o installer.php
  php installer.php
  php composer.phar install
Now You should now have a folder called hd-wallet-derive containing the PHP library!
